Pierre monitors Polyglots translations and notifies teams via Slack ðŸª¨

== Description ==

Pierre is a WordPress plugin that helps translation teams stay on top of their Polyglots projects by monitoring translation progress and sending notifications via Slack.

**The Story Behind Pierre**

Pierre loves WordPress, Pierre loves WordPress when it displays IN HIS LANGUAGE, Pierre loves translating some strings on translate.wordpress.org from time to time.

But Pierre really struggles to be consistent and keep up with the release rhythm of the plugins he helps translate.

So he talks to Jason, who translates little, but often discusses with locale managers, GTE, PTE and remembers an old project initiated by a friend of his (hold on, it's worth it): a Belgian, named Pascal. Pascal is a nerd and loves tinkering with APIs, especially those from wordpress.org. In 2016, he set up small tools to crawl, then display data from translate.wordpress.org and thus help translators be notified on their slack of strings pending translation.

INTRODUCING to you: WP-Pierre. The evolution of this old idea, rewritten from scratch, joined to a site https://pierre.jasonrouet.com/ (temporary url) to simplify access to this tool for any local WordPress community and manage: adding translation teams + connecting your local community Slack.

**Fun fact:** The name "Pierre" is inspired by the [Rosetta Stone](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Rosette), the famous artifact that helped decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs - just like this plugin helps decipher translation needs! ðŸª¨
